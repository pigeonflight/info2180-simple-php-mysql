This is just a demo for INFO2180.
The code shows basic PHP integration with MYSQL.

To get started create the world.sql database.

On Cloud9 this can be done as follows:

mysql-ctl start

(remember to note your credentials)

mysql-ctl cli

mysql> create database world;
mysql> use world;

(Edit line 4 of the database-demo.php file and add replace 'pigeonflight' with 
your user credentials)
